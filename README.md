This website is designed to help you learn any topic by using spaced repetition, which is intended to remind you of what you're just about to forget, right before you forget it (ideally). 
This flask project can be located at: https://dosomereps.com 
I could use some help getting this project to the next level if anyone is interested. 
Either way, it's in a working state now and new features will be slowly added to it as time permits.
Enjoy.
